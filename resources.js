Due to the simplicity of the combinators one can insert even extensive type checks with very minimal effort.  Using Signatures to be mixed in one can opt to use Signatures while development and then leaving them out when deploying. Library authors may want to ship developer versions with Signature files and deployment versions without type checking (which will additionally reduce source size). So 'dynamic' type checking is fully optional and the extra cycles needed to do type checking can be omitted when deploying later."]

Compilers do not have access to static type information, making generation of efficient, type-specialized machine code difficult. To avoid incurring extra overhead on the programmer and to improve the performance of deployed JavaScript programs, we seek to solve this problem by inferring types. Existing type inference algorithms for JavaScript are often too computationally intensive and too imprecise -especially in the case of JavaScript's extensible objects- to enable optimizations. Both problems arise from performing purely static analyses. In this paper we present a hybrid type inference algorithm for JavaScript based on points-to analysis. Our algorithm is fast, in that it pays for itself in the optimizations it enables. Our algorithm is also precise, generating information that closely reflects the program's actual behavior, by augmenting static analysis with run-time type barriers.","We showcase an implementation forMozilla Firefox's JavaScript engine, demonstrating both performance gains and viability. Through integration with the just-in-time (JIT) compiler in Firefox, we have improved its performance on major benchmarks and JavaScript-heavy websites by up to 50%.

Such evaluations are especially relevant to dynamically typed languages such as JavaScript, which are currently evaluating the idea of adding optional type annotations.  We demonstrate that low-level optimizations rarely accelerate the program enough to pay back the investment into performing them in an optionally typed language.
